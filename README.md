# python-honeyshell
Python based SSH honeypot
-------------------------

This project was never completed, but I'd like to find time to work on it again.   It was an attempt to create functionality similar to what is provided by the 'kippo' open source SSH honeypot, but I was hoping to make it RHEL specific and something that would hold up to closer scrutiny (i.e. be more realistic and convincing).   

More than anything it was an excuse to play with the paramiko SSH libraries and challenge myself to try to emulate a convinincing BASH shell with Python.
